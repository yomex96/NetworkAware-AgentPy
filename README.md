Figure: Agents in a networked environment with adaptive and resilient behaviors.

ðŸ”¹ Analysis & Metrics
This project supports analysis of:

Communication success rate: Messages successfully delivered under packet loss

Coordination efficiency: How effectively agents complete tasks under network constraints

Resilience: Performance under simulated network failures

Emergent behavior: Patterns that arise from decentralized agent interactions

Example Python snippet for communication success rate:

python
Copy code
success_counts = []
for _ in range(steps):
    successes = sum(random.random() > env.packet_loss for _ in links)
    success_counts.append(successes)
success_rate = np.array(success_counts) / len(links)
Visualization of metrics is included in the demo notebook.
