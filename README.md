## **2. Python snippet to generate visual abstract**

Create `docs/generate_network_visual.py`:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create graph
G = nx.DiGraph()

# Add agents (nodes)
agents = ["Vehicle A", "Vehicle B", "Drone C", "Sensor D"]
G.add_nodes_from(agents)

# Add network-aware edges (arrows)
edges = [("Vehicle A", "Vehicle B"), ("Vehicle B", "Drone C"),
         ("Drone C", "Sensor D"), ("Sensor D", "Vehicle A")]
G.add_edges_from(edges)

# Position nodes in a grid-like layout
pos = {
    "Vehicle A": (0, 1),
    "Vehicle B": (1, 1),
    "Drone C": (0, 0),
    "Sensor D": (1, 0)
}

# Draw nodes and edges
plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, node_size=1200, node_color="skyblue")
nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos, font_size=10)
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, arrowstyle="->", arrowsize=20, edge_color="gray", width=2)

# Title
plt.title("NetworkAware-AgentPy: Multi-Agent Network Simulation", fontsize=12)
plt.axis("off")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig("docs/network_visual.png", dpi=300)
plt.show()
````

* Running this will produce `network_visual.png` automatically for your README.
