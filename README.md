AgentPy is an open-source library for the development and analysis of agent-based models in Python.
The framework integrates the tasks of model design, interactive simulations, numerical experiments,
and data analysis within a single environment. The package is optimized for interactive computing
with [IPython](http://ipython.org/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

**Note:** AgentPy is no longer under active development. For new projects, we recommend using [MESA](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/stable/).

**Installation:** `pip install agentpy`
