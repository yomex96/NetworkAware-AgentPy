Sequences
=========

This module offers various data structures to create and manage groups
of both agents and environments. Which structure best to use
depends on the specific requirements of each model.

- :class:`AgentList` is a list of agentpy objects with
  methods to select and manipulate its entries.
- :class:`AgentDList` is an ordered collection of agentpy objects,
  optimized for removing and looking up objects.
- :class:`AgentSet` is an unordered collection of agents
  that can access agent attributes.
- :class:`AgentIter` and :class:`AgentDListIter` are a list-like iterators
  over a selection of agentpy objects.
- :class:`AttrIter` is a list-like iterator over the attributes of
  each agent in a selection of agentpy objects.

All of these sequence classes can access and manipulate
the methods and variables of their objects as an attribute of the container.
For examples, see :class:`AgentList`.
